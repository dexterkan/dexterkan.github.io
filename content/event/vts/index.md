summary: An oral presentation introduces our work on fog computing system at VTS APWCS.
abstract: 'Mobile-edge Computing (MEC) system, a kind of fog computing system, is a promising paradigm to provide computation resources in proximate of the end users. However, due to the limitation of radio and computation resources, a proper mechanism for resource allocation is essential. In this paper, we study the joint offloading decision and resource allocation problem. To make our MEC system more effective, we optimize both radio and computing resources by our self-defined priority function and Lagrange Multiplier. Furthermore, the load distribution among multiple MEC servers is taken into account to enhance the performance of MEC system. To promote QoS as well as considering the variety of delay tolerance of tasks, we design a cost function related to the delay tolerance of tasks and propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the cost minimization problem. Numerical results show that better performances are achieved by our proposed algorithm.'
