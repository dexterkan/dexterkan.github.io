summary: Shared our ongoing work on privacy-preserving ML systems through a poster presentation
abstract: "<div style='text-align: justify;'> Applications like mixed reality rely heavily on vision models. However, due to the high complexity of these vision tasks and the limited processing power of mobile devices, these models are typically deployed on distributed systems with multiple remote servers to optimize utility and minimize latency. This setup, however, requires users to share personal data with remote servers, posing potential privacy risks. To address this challenge, we propose a system that enables real-time private inference for vision tasks within distributed environments.</div>"
