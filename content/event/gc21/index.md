summary: An oral presentation introduces our work on intelligent reflecting surfaces at GLOBECOM.
abstract: 'This paper investigates a multiuser downlink communication system with coexisting intelligent reﬂecting surface (IRS) and classical half-duplex decode-and-forward (DF) relay. In this system, the IRS and the DF relay interact with each other and assist transmission simultaneously. In particular, active beamforming at the base station (BS) and at the DF relay, and passive beamforming at the IRS, are jointly designed to maximize the sum-rate of all users. The sum-rate maximization problem is non-convex due to the coupled beamforming vectors. We propose an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm to tackle this complex co-design problem. Numerical validation and discussion on the superiority of the coexistence system and the tradeoffs therein are presented.'
