summary: "Applying Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to edge deployment faces major challenges due to limited device resources, privacy risks from cloud data offloading, and inaccurate performance estimation under dynamic hardware conditions. Architectures optimized offline in the cloud often fail to remain optimal as device latency, memory, and workload fluctuate over time. We propose Cloud–Edge Neural Architecture Search, a hybrid framework that combines cloud-scale search with on-device refinement. The cloud stage identifies strong candidate architectures using public data, while the edge stage adapts these candidates to local data and real-time device constraints, ensuring compliance with strict latency and memory budgets. This design reduces privacy exposure, avoids expensive on-device search, and enables rapid re-adaptation as device conditions change by restarting only the lightweight edge phase. Preliminary results on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and Freiburg datasets show that our approach adapts efficiently to dynamic edge environments, achieving competitive performance with minimal degradation compared to cloud-only NAS, while offering improved privacy and practicality for real-world deployment."
