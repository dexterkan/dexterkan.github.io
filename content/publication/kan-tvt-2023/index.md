summary: Reconﬁgurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are viewed as key enablers for next-generation wireless communications. This paper investigates a multiuser downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) system in which a multiantenna base station (BS) transmits information to multiple single-antenna users with the aid of both a half-duplex decode-and-forward (DF) relay and a full-duplex RIS. Active beamforming at the BS and the DF relay, as well as passive beamforming at the RIS, are jointly designed for system sum-rate maximization. The design problem is challenging to solve due to coupled beamforming variables. An alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm is proposed to tackle this complex co-design problem. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed hybrid relay–RIS system with a judicious joint beamforming design. Convergence and complexity analysis shows that the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is dominated by the numbers of users and RIS elements, and the proposed scheme can converge in a few iterations even in the conﬁguration of large numbers of users and RIS elements. Interesting tradeoffs posed in the joint design are discussed. An extension of the proposed design method to a related energy efﬁciency (EE) optimization problem is also outlined and implemented.

# summary: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>This paper studies a multiuser MISO downlink system assisted by a decode-and-forward relay and a full-duplex RIS. To maximize the system sum-rate, joint active and passive beamforming is optimized using an alternating optimization algorithm. Results show that the proposed hybrid relay–RIS scheme achieves high performance and fast convergence, even with many users and RIS elements. Trade-offs in joint design and an extension to energy efficiency optimization are also explored.</p>"
