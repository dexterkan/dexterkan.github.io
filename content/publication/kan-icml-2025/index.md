abstract: "<div style='text-align: justify;'>We present a hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework tailored for mobile and edge devices. The method jointly optimizes latency, energy, and accuracy using device-specific cost models and multi-objective search. Experiments on representative vision tasks show the generated models reduce end-to-end latency and energy while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, making NAS practical for resource-constrained deployments.</div>"
summary: Hardware-aware NAS for mobile/edge that co-optimizes latency, energy, and accuracy with device-specific cost models and multi-objective search; submitted to ICML.
