      - Proposed a coexistence system that a multiuser downlink MISO communication is assisted by a coexisting full-duplex IRS and half-duplex decode-and-forward relay.
      - Designed an alternating optimization based algorithm to maximize the sum-rate of all the users by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the base station, the active beamforming at the relay, and the passive beamforming at the IRS.
      - Validated the superiority of the proposed coexistence system by simulations and provided insightful discussion about the tradeoffs in the design of joint beamforming.

## About Me

<p style='text-align: justify;'>As a dedicated PhD Fellow at USC, my research focuses on privacy-preserving machine learning systems and efficient task scheduling within vehicular edge networks. My teaching experience, including courses in probability and computer networking, has strengthened my ability to communicate with colleagues, convey complex technical concepts clearly, and reinforce my expertise in computer networking. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Before joining USC, I earned my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from NTU, Taiwan, in 2019, and my M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UCLA in 2020. I also worked as a Research Assistant in wireless communications at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. </p>
