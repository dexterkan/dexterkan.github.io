<p style='text-align: justify;'> ReconÔ¨Ågurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are viewed as key enablers for next-generation wireless communications. This paper investigates a multiuser downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) system in which a multiantenna base station (BS) transmits information to multiple single-antenna users with the aid of both a half-duplex decode-and-forward (DF) relay and a full-duplex RIS. Active beamforming at the BS and the DF relay, as well as passive beamforming at the RIS, are jointly designed for system sum-rate maximization. The design problem is challenging to solve due to coupled beamforming variables. An alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm is proposed to tackle this complex co-design problem. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed hybrid relay‚ÄìRIS system with a judicious joint beamforming design. Convergence and complexity analysis shows that the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is dominated by the numbers of users and RIS elements, and the proposed scheme can converge in a few iterations even in the conÔ¨Åguration of large numbers of users and RIS elements. Interesting tradeoffs posed in the joint design are discussed. An extension of the proposed design method to a related energy efÔ¨Åciency (EE) optimization problem is also outlined and implemented. </p>
