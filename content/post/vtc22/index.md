<p style='text-align: justify;'> This paper proposes a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) symbol detector that incorporates a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent into the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) detection algorithm. A self-designed deep reinforcement learning agent, consisting of a policy value network and a state value network, is trained to detect MIMO symbols. The outputs of the trained networks are adopted into a modiÔ¨Åed MCTS detection algorithm to provide useful node statistics and facilitate enhanced tree search process. The resulted scheme, termed the DeepMCTS detector, demonstrates signiÔ¨Åcant performance and complexity advantages over the original MCTS detection algorithm under varying channel conditions. </p>
